	    This application was implemented in Roskilde University,Denmark from the Erasmus students: 
	    Aitor Martin Marin, Juan Javier Garcia Cervera and Andreas-Chantriolnt Kapouranis. <br /><br />

	    The main feature of the system is to provide the users the chance to share their location using a mobile phone. 
	    The process for sending the position of one person's location is done automatically. Also the user can search and 
	    add new friends, this way he is going to be able to see his friend's location in an intuitive and easy way.
